-- A lightweight UPDATE writes a patch that still stores `t`. A later metadata-only
-- `RENAME COLUMN t TO t2` must not hide that patch from the flatten classifier:
-- `getPatchesForColumns` already translates the name, and the leaf-readability
-- proof has to do the same or the merge stays on Horizontal.
